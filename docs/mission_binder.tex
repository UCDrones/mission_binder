\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All UAS activity must establish a buffer or safe-zone between the Unmanned Aircraft and any non-participating persons or sensitive locations.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A good rule-of-thumb is to maintain a buffer or safe-zone of roughly \(\frac{1}{4}^{th}\) of the flight altitude.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Visual Observers and supporting ground crew should be utilized when available.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Supporting ground crew should assist in ensuring safety to all non-participating persons.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  All members of the flight crew must be conspicuous and wear professional, identifying apparel such as university-branded hats, shirts or lanyards with IDs.
\item
  High visibility reflective vests must be worn when operating near roads or in parking lots.\\
\item
  When operating in fenced areas, operate exclusively within the fenced areas unless there is sufficient visibility on the other side to ensure safety to non-participants.
\item
  Never fly in areas where UAS activity is prohibited or restricted.
\item
  Always be a good neighbor and ensure that your UAS activity is not disruptive to other authorized activities.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{operating-on-campus-or-other-busy-locations}{%
\section{Operating on Campus or other busy locations}\label{operating-on-campus-or-other-busy-locations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Utilize the UC UAS Mission Planning Template (\href{http://ucdrones.github.io/library/mission_planning_template.docx}{link}) to systematically develop your flight plan
\item
  When operating in uncontrolled locations in proximity to non-participating persons, extra care should be exercised. Specific flight paths and altitudes should be pre-planned such that potential gaps in buffer or safe-zones can be identified.
\item
  High visibility vests are recommended, but not required when near nonparticipants or in public areas
\item
  Orange cones may be used to help communicate Unmanned Aircraft flight regions to non-participating persons, but are not fully sufficient.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Supplement any portable pedestrian control equipment (cones, caution tape, signs) with ground personnel
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If spectators are expected, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with preventing spectators from distracting the RPIC with questions or comments.
\item
  When operating near roads, a supporting ground crew member should be tasked with being located near the road to monitor traffic, and if necessary, retrieve a fallen Unmanned Aircraft before it becomes a road hazard.
\item
  Flying above buildings and structures minimizes risk to pedestrians, but it is recommended to contact the facility manager to properly evaluate the potential risks. Some campus buildings are outfitted with research or communication equipment on rooftops.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{privacy-guidelines}{%
\chapter{Privacy Guidelines}\label{privacy-guidelines}}

In the United States today, the use of UAS for both recreation and commercial use are becoming ever more prominent. UAS may be used for a variety of applications, including photography and videography. The capture and use of photographs and videos from a UAS platform raises new concerns on the rights, privacies, and permissions that involve both the operators of UAS and individuals that are uninvolved in the operation. The University of California recognizes the important value of privacy and strives to achieve an appropriate balance ensuring an appropriate level of privacy, nurturing an environment of openness, honoring its obligation as a public institution to remain transparent while safe guarding information about individuals.

\textbf{Best Practices}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} use a UAS to monitor or record activities where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} use a UAS for unapproved recordings of any campus events or performances, or for any unlawful purposes.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} fly a UAS over private property without prior approval.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} use a UAS to harass people or intentionally disrupt events
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} use a UAS for the specific purpose of persistent and continuous collection of identifiable data about individuals without the consent of the data subjects.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} retain identifiable data longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill a purpose.
\item
  \textbf{Do Not} knowingly publicly disclose data collected with a UAS without undertaking a reasonable effort to obfuscate or de-identify identifiable data unless the data subjects provide specific consent to the disclosure.
\item
  \textbf{Do} make a reasonable effort to provide prior notice to individuals of the general timeframe and area that they may anticipate a UAS intentionally collecting data.
\item
  \textbf{Do} establish and make available a Privacy Policy for UAS data if the UAS may intentionally or unintentionally collected identifiable data. The policy should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the data collected.
\item
  \textbf{Do} be considerate of other people's concerns over privacy, security and safety.
\item
  \textbf{Do} contact the Office of Research Compliance and Integrity if identifiable data is to be used for human-subject research.
\item
  \textbf{Do} take steps to ensure the security of any identifiable data.
